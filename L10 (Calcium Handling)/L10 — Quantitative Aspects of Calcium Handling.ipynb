    "# Excitation-Contraction Coupling in the Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 200 years ago, Luigi Galvani reported that the leg muscles of dead frogs would twitch if he created an electrical spark. This was the beginning of the study of *excitation-contraction coupling*, the process where electrical activation of a muscle cell causes it to contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have so far studied the cellular action potential in detail, and have seen how gated ion channels in the cell membrane are responsible for producing these spontaneous electrical signals. We will now try to understand how depolarization of the membrane can cause the cell to contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The action potential occurs mainly at the cell membrane, but contraction occurs in the myofilaments within the cell. For exciation and contraction to be coupled, we therefore need some process which can transport the signal from the depolarizing cell membrane, into the cytosol and bind to the myofilaments. It turns out that this signal is mediated by diffusing calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calcium as a signaling molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid changes in the membrane potential of the cell during an action potential occurs due to electrically charged ions (mainly Na$^+$, K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$) passing through ion channels in the membrane. For sodium and potassium, these fluxes have relatively small impacts on the intracellular ion concentrations, and these shift at most a few percent. For calcium, however, the relative change in concentration can enormous, with the cytosolic calcium levels increasing by as much as a thousandfold on the order of tens of milliseconds. This is not because calcium fluxes are much larger in magnitude than sodium and potassium, but rather that the diastolic calcium levels are *incredibly* low, typically as low as ~100 nM, meaning the relative changes in concentrations become much larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid increase in calcium concentration in the cell is known as the calcium *transient*. This is because calcium levels decay back to resting levels during repolarization, and so the increased calcium levels occur only *transiently*. Put simply, we can say that this calcium transient is what triggers contraction of the cell. Precisely because the transient is so strong and occurs only during systole, it is a very clear signal in the cell. In comparison, sodium and potassium levels have such small relative shifts that they have poor signal-to-noise ratio.\n",

    "In addition to being a signal for contraction, calcium is a signal for a large number of process in the cell, both short term and long term. In the short term, elevated calcium levels can drive the activity of kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, exchangers and transporters. In the long term, elevated levels of calcium can be responsible for function, growth, gene expression, differentiation, remodeling and development of cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, calcium makes a lot of stuff happen. In chronic heart disease, calcium handling is often found to be disrupted. In addition, calcium handling is quite different across mammalian species, and understanding these differences can be crucial when using animal models or develop drugs. While calcium is important for a large number of signaling pathways, what we mainly want to focus on right now is how the calcium transient itself is formed, and how it decays back to resting levels.\n",

    "### Force as a function of the calcium transient\n",
    "\n",
    "Contraction of the cell occurs when there is enough free calcium in the cytosol, which can then bind to organelles known as *myofilaments*, causing contraction. The mechanism of force production in the myofilaments is described by *sliding filament theory*, which is the topic of the following lectures. For now we want to simple state that free calcium causes contraction, and that contraction ends once calcium levels drop back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that contraction is *not* an all-or-nothing response to calcium. Rather, the strength of contraction is a direct function of the *magnitude* of the calcium transient. We can model this using the Hill equation, using a Hill coefficient of $n=4$ and a half-saturation point of $K_{1/2} = 600$ nM free calcium. If you recall our discussion on the Hill equation, a coefficient of 4 means force production will be sigmoidal, with a steep dependence on the magnitude of the calcium transient. This is shown in Figure 4 below (the smaller inset curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4 contains two graphs, and the distinction between the two is important. The smaller inset graph shows force production as a function of *free* cytosolic calcium, i.e, the actual concentration $\\rm [Ca^{2+}]_i$. The larger graph shows instead how much calcium we have to *add* to the cytosol to trigger contraction. \n",
    "The difference from the two comes mainly from the fact that the cytosol contains a large number of calcium buffers, that will effectively bind and lower the free calcium levels following any Ca$^{2+}$-influx. We therefore need to add a lot more calcium than what would naively think, to properly trigger contraction.\n",

    "The process outlined above repeats for every single beat of the heart. For every action potential there is calcium influx, triggering contraction, and then a decay back to baseline as calcium is pumped back out of the cytosol. This process is sometimes called *calcium cycling*, to emphasize the cyclical manner in which calcium moves back and forth between the different domains. There are some subtle balances in this cycling that is very important for how the cell is regulated.\n",

    "Because all calcium that enters the cell enters into the same domain, NCX and SERCA effectively *compete* for the same calcium when they pump it back out. If one is more active, then the other will get less. However, the calcium that is pumped by the SERCA pump does not leave the cell entirely, but is rather stored in the SR. This stored calcium can then help strengthen the next calcium transient.\n",

    "If *more* calcium is pumped by SERCA than is released by RyR, then the amount of calcium stored in the SR, increases. This is called the *SR load*. If the SR load is higher, then RyR would release more calcium in the next beat, giving stronger transients. If *less* calcium is pumped by SERCA, then the SR load would *decrease*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the heart is continuously pumping, it is clear that the SR load cannot decrease or increase forever. Instead, the system will spontaneously tend towards a balance where the amount of calcium released from the SR is the same amount that is pumped back into the SR by SERCA. The same must then necessarily be through for the L-type and NCX. So unless there are some shift in conditions, and we are at *steady-cycle*, then for each beat of have \n",

    "The simplest model of SERCA we propose comes from assuming first order kinematics and also assumes that any activity in the reverse direction is negligible, making it a *unidirectional* pump model. We can then model the pumping activity using the same approach as we used for the Michaelis-Menten equation. However, because SERCA pumps two and two ions we also get cooperativity into our model and use a Hill coefficient of 2. The unidirectional pump model therefore becomes\n",

    "Here ${\\rm EC}_{\\rm 50}$ is the concentration required for a half-maximal pump velocity, EC stands for *effective concentration*. This model effectively states that SERCA behaves like a simple enzymatic reaction, transporting/converting calcium without getting used up in the process. \n",

    "The unidirectional model is very simple, both conceptually and in terms of the mathematics and implementation. It has only two adjustable parameters, $v_{\\rm max}$ and EC$_{\\rm 50}$. Because SERCA is a high-affinity, high-capacity pump both of these values are high. In mammalian myocyte, the best fit of this parameters is on the order of 0.3 ÂµM, which is only a few hundred nM above baseline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its simplicity, the unidirectional pump model sees quite some use. However, it does have some major issues, the biggest of which is that it does not care about the SR load whatsoever, in fact, this model predicts SERCA will keep pumping away calcium from the cytosol until there is nothing left. This is not only not physiological, it is *unphysical* as it breaks the law of thermodynamics, as we saw in our discussion above. Because of this, models that use a unidirectional SERCA pump often have to add a leak calcium current from the SR into the cytosol to balance the over-active SERCA. This can work in practice, but one always have to be very careful with such models, as they are not guaranteed to behave well with changing conditions."

    "Instead of trying to add the SR load dependence as a scaling factor on the current, we can do the more physiologically accurate thing and model it as a proper bidirectional pump. The simplest way to do this is to assume that the two *modes* of the pump (i.e., the forward and reverse) are independent of each other. We can then model the two modes using our simple unidirectional pump model, i.e., using the Michaelis-Menten equation with a Hill coefficient of 2:\n",

    "We have effectively only added one more parameter to our model and conceptually, this model is nearly as simple as the unidirectional model. On the other hand, it turns out to be much more physiologically accurate under a wider range of conditions. First of, the pump actually shuts of when it reaches a certain SR:cytosol ratio, as we can see from solving the equation $J_{\\rm pump} = 0$:\n",

However, ions can also bind, and unbind without getting transported. With the sheer amount of SERCA molecules inside the cell, this means there is, at any given time, a substantial amount of calcium ions bound to SERCA, thus SERCA is acting like a calcium *buffer*. We will discuss buffers and their effect more in the next lecture. For now, suffice to say that SERCA is the second largest calcium buffer in the cell (i.e., it binds a lot of calcium), and a detailed model should include this.\n",

The pump velocity will be the *cycling rate* of the model, i.e., the rate at which a full cycle of all four steps occurs.

    "# Measuring intracellular calcium dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, you've heard some about how one can constrain electrophysiological models of ion channels and pumps from experimental measurements from for example patch clamp. For internal channels and pumps such as SERCA and RyR this is more complicated, because these channels only appear internally to the cell and so cannot be patch clamped. So how can we measure intracellular calcium dynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "One method is to add calcium indicators into the cell. These are fluorophores that bind calcium and start to glow. Using optical microscopes, we can then measure the amount of fluroesence to find an estimate of the calcium concentrations within the cell. While calcium indicators are useful, they are also quite tricky to work with, and there are limitations in both the spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, the indicators work by binding calcium, meaning you are adding a buffer into the system which buffers precisely what you are trying to measure, which will affect the measurement at least somewhat. Because of this we can also add the buffering capacity of a calcium indicators in models we make that reproduce such experiments to make it easier to compare simulation and experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way one can get insight into the intracellular dynamics, is to measure the sarcolemmal currents which *can be* patch-clamped, such as the NCX. Take for example measuring the SR load of a cell. If we add caffeine into the cell, the cell releases all its calcium into the cytosol (caffeine triggers RyR to open). In the cytosol some of this calcium gets pumped back into the SR by SERCA, but as the RyR is open, this just goes right back into the cytosol. The NCX however, is also pumping calcium out of the cell, and this efflux of calcium we can measure through a patch clamp. By integrating this current we get a good estimate of how much calcium was in the cell and SR. This measurement is however, not a *dynamic* measurement, you get a one time measurement, but you have removed all calcium from the cell itself. Effectively you are draining the entire cell of its calcium and measuring how much there is in total.\n",

    "We now turn to look closer at the other major actor responsible for cytosolic calcium decay, the Na$^{+}$/Ca$^{2+}$-exchanger, or NCX for short. Unlike SERCA, which pumps calcium into the SR, the NCX takes calcium out of the cell entirely. NCX pushes calcium against its concentration gradient, by allowing for a co-transport of sodium along its concentration gradient. For each calcium ion transported across the membrane, three sodium ions are transported in the opposite direction. Because of this, the NCX is responsible for carrying two transmembrane fluxes, a calcium current, and a sodium current. Because calcium ions has a charge of $2e$, and sodium ions have a charge of $e$, there will be a net transport of charge for each NCX cycle, so the NCX is not only responsible for ion transport, but will also change the membrane potential."

Under normal conditions, this occurs during the repolarizing phase of the action potential, and the inward current is more than accounted for by other outward currents. In abnormal cases where the cell is at rest though, the NCX can potentially be strong enough to depolarize the cell enough to trigger a new action potential. A sudden and spontaneous release of calcium from the SR while the cell is at rest for example, could trigger an AP. We will discuss this more when we look closer at the RyR calcium release channel."

    "Another important phenomenological outcome of calcium cycling is that cardiomyocytes are self-regulating. Again, we will only show some examples of this, and not go into the finer details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure below is from a cardiomyocyte experiment. Here they are pacing the cell at a regular pace, and measuring the amount of shortening per beat. The shortening of the cell is proportional to the calcium transient. When pacing at a regular pace, the calcium transient and thus shortening is fairly constant, the cell is at a steady cycle. In the experiment, they now add a bit of caffine to the system. Caffine binds to the calcium release channels (RyR), making it easier for them to open. The easier opening gives a bigger calcium release and a much bigger transient. This response occurs very fast, and right after the caffine is introduced, we see a much larger shortening of the cell. However, over the next few beats, the shortening response becomes smaller and smaller untill it is back to its baseline. This is not due to any manipulation from our side, it is the cell that is self-regulating, or *auto-regulating* back to its baseline. To understand why this occurs, think of where the increased calcium is coming from. The caffine triggers bigger release from the SR, but the SERCA is not upregulated, and so this additional cytosolic calcium will be evenly split between NCX and SERCA. Some of the additional calcium will thus leave the cell, resulting in decreasing SR load with each beat. With decreasing SR load, the calcium release becomes weaker, untill we eventually reach a new equilibrium.\n",

    "When caffine is removed from the system, we see the opposite response. With no caffine, the RyR are again hard to open, leading to a smaller release of calcium from the SR (due to the low SR load). However, as the release is smaller, a relatively speaking larger amount of calcium is entering through the L-type than through the RyRs, and again, this calcium is split between NCX and SERCA. SERCA therefore refills the SR load for every beat, which leads to stronger release again, untill we are back to the baseline value we had earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same authors carried out the same experiment, but adding *tetracaine*  instead of caffine, which has the opposite effect on RyR, it inhibits release. Right after adding tetracaine to the system, the calcium release is much weaker, giving a small calcium transient and little shortening. However, over the next 10-20 beats, the cell is auto-regulating by increasing its SR load, untill we are back to nearly the same baseline as we started at. Taking tetracaine off the system gives the same behavior as when removing caffine, the increased SR load gives a larger shortening, but after some time the SR load has decreased back to its original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment they also measured both the L-type current and the NCX current of the cell, which when summed gives us a measure of the total amount of calcium entering and leaving the cell. We see that this measurement at baseline goes to 0 over one beat (measured points at a and c). This means there is no net calcium entering or leaving the cell, and thus the SR load is constant. However, after perturbing the system, we see that the integral does *not* go to 0. This means a net amount of calcium is either entering or leaving the cell (entering at point b, and leaving at point d). This calcium cannot be in the cytosol, so it has to end up in the SR.\n",
