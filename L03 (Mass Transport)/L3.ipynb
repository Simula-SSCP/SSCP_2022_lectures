    "\n",
    "The first topic we cover is the law of mass action, which we covered in the recorded lecture. We will now repeat how we can set up an ODE system, and I'll show you how you can solve the ODE system using Python. To solve the equations numerically, we will use the function [`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html). The name `solve_ivp` is short for \"solve initial value problem\", which is another way of describing the mathematical problem we are looking at. If you normally use another programming language, such as Matlab, similar functions are available there.\n",

    "#### Explanation of `solve_ivp`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the function `solve_ivp` to be able to solve the system, it needs three inputs:\n",
    "1. The ODE system itself, i.e., the equations.\n",
    "2. The initial values of each state.\n",
    "3. What time points to solve for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specify the ODE equations themselves, we implement them as a Python function. More specifically, we write out the derivatives of the system as a vector equation on the form\n",
    "$$\\frac{{\\rm d}\\vec{y}}{{\\rm d}t} = \\vec{f}(t, {\\vec y}).$$\n",
    "Here, $y$ is a single variable (scalar) if you have a single ODE, or a sequence of variables if you have a system of ODEs. These variables are often referred to as the *state* variables or simply *states* of the system. \n",
    "In our example, it would for example be\n",
    "$$\\vec{y} = (\\mathrm{[Mb]}, \\mathrm{[O_2]}, \\mathrm{[MbO_2]}).$$\n",
    "In addition, the function $f$ takes in the time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $\\vec{f}$ should now represent the right-hand side of the ODE-system, i.e., the derivative of each state in the system. In our case, this would be\n",
    "$$\\vec{f}(t, \\vec{y}) = \\bigg(\\frac{\\mathrm{d [Mb]}}{\\mathrm{d}t},  \\frac{\\mathrm{d [O_2]}}{\\mathrm{d}t}, \\frac{\\mathrm{d [Mb O_2]}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\bigg).$$\n",
    "Note that the order you list the states is not important, but it **is** important that the order you place them in is the same for the vector $y$ and the RHS.\n"

    "\n",
    "We will now turn to a topic that builds naturally from the law of mass action, which is enzyme kinematics. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions, meaning they speed up the reactions, without being consumed in the process. There are many different mechanisms for how an enzyme can achieve this, but we won't go into these details. Instead we want to look at a simplified and understandable model of how enzymes work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes generally work by somehow lowering the energy barrier of a chemical reaction. This can for example be achieved by binding to an intermediate state in the reaction. Recall now Arrhenius' law, which stated that the rate constant of a reaction could be written as\n",
    "$$k = Ae^{-E_{\\rm barrier}/k_{\\rm B}T}.$$\n",
    "This relation tells us that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the exponential of the activation energy. Thus, even a relatively small reduction in the energy barrier of a given reaction can cause a huge change in reaction speed. Because of this, enzymes are usually highly efficient and can speed up reactions by many orders of magnitude ($>10^7$ in some cases!). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/activation_barrier_enzyme.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The drastic change in reaction speed due to enzymes is hugely important for cellular function. We can effectively have reacting systems in the cell that have a rate so slow that they are effectively stable, but as soon as a bit of enzyme is added, things start happening. In this sense, enzymes can be thought of as on-buttons for various processes in the cell that are lying in standby. An example of this is the energy carrier molecules ATP. These molecules carry a fair bit of chemical energy, and so will spontaneously dissociate and release energy. However, the rate of this dissociation is very slow, and so it takes a very long time for ATP to dissociate on its own. The cell can therefore produce ATP through metabolism and let it sit for a while, without fear of wasting energy. Molecular machines can now be equipped with enzymes that speed up the dissociation of ATP, harnessing some of the released energy in the process. These enzymatic machines are known as *ATPases*, and we will see some of examples of these later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enzymes change reaction speed, not direction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that an enzyme can never change the net change in Gibb's energy in a reaction, and will therefore never be able to change the direction of a reaction. An enzyme cannot trigger a reaction that is not spontaneous on its own, it can just speed it up. The upside however, is that the enzyme molecules doesn't get used up in the reaction, and therefore even a small amount of enzyme is usually enough to trigger some process."

    "The exact action of enzymes can vary a lot, and can be challenging to explore properly due to their specific nature and the complexity of large proteins. For example, the exact way the enzyme *catalase* works remains elusive, despite it being common to more or less all life that processes oxygen. So we won't try to model *how* an enzyme works, but instead what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at how we can model the activity of an enzyme with a simple model. While simple, this model is incredibly useful, and sees a  lot of use in physiological modeling. As it is a simplified model with some underlying assumptions, it is often referred to as first-order kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes work by binding to some molecule, the *substrate*, converting it, and then releasing the *product*. We therefore propose the following reaction to model this activity\n",
    "$${\\rm S} + {\\rm E} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\overset{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} {\\rm ES} \\overset{k_2}{\\rightarrow} {\\rm E} + {\\rm P}.$$\n",
    "Here S is the substrate that is to be converted and E is the enzyme, these can bind together and form an enzyme-substrate complex, ES. The ES complex can either break up again without converting the substrate, or the substrate can be converted and the complex breaks up into a free enzyme molecule and a product molecule, P. We assume that once the product has been released by the enzyme, it no longer binds to the enzyme spontaneously, so there is no reverse arrow in the final reaction."

    "$$v = \\dot{[{\\rm P}]} = k_2[{\\rm ES}],$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, take a note to compare the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the hill equation. Note how similar these are. In fact, the Michaelis-Menten equation is a special case of the Hill equation where $n=1$, meaning we assume there is no cooperativity involved.\n",

    "### Enzyme Inhibition\n",
    "\n",
    "Another class of molecules are the enzyme *inhibitors*. These are molecules that reduce, or completely shut of, the activity of enzymes. There are different functional ways for inhibitors to work, but the simplest mechanism is simply binding to enzyme more readily than the actual substrate, but then not actually converting to anything. Thus the enzymes waste their binding time on the inhibitors rather than the substrate. Enzyme inhibition is another important tool in the cell for regulating behavior, and many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. An example of this is penicillin, which inhibits an enzyme bacteria need for cell wall synthesis, eventually killing the bacteria as it is unable to maintain its own cell wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the Michaelis-Menten model to include enzyme inhibitors is quite easy, we simply add the inhibitor as a new species $I$, and new reactions to the system where the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme. It then turns out we can make slightly different models, depending on where the inhibitor binds. These different models would behave differently in practice. When comparing to experiment, it turns out that the different models correspond to different inhibitors, and so in practice, different enzyme inhibitors are grouped into different classes. The figure below shows how the Michaelis-Menten model would be extended for each of these groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/enzyme_inhibition.png\" width=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these cases, we could go through our analysis again, setting up the kinetics from the law of mass action, assume equilibrium and quasi-static conditions, and find expressions for the first-order enzyme kinetics. While we won't go through all the algebra here, the model predictions we end up with agree well with experiment, and are often very useful in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, the Michaelis-Menten model is quite simple, but surprisingly powerful, the fact that it can so easily be extende to include the effects of inhibitors is another reason it is so often used in biomedical modeling.\n"

If $V=E_{\\rm Na}$, they have no desire to do so, but if $V \\neq E_{\\rm Na}$, there will be a net transport of sodium that tries to shift the membrane potential closer to the Nernst potential. This means that if $V < E_{\\rm Na}$, sodium will enter into the cell (influx), while if $V > E_{\\rm Na}$, sodium will tend to leave the cell, to shift the membrane potential downward (efflux).
