    "# The Law of Mass Action\n",
    "\n",
    "The first topic we cover is the *law of mass action*, which models the rate of chemical reactions and is one of the most fundamental concepts in chemistry. As an example we will look at the binding reaction between oxygen and *myoglobin*, an oxygen-binding globular protein found in muscle cells. If an environment contains both free oxygen molecules and myoglobin, the two can combine to form a *oxymyoglobin* complex. We can write this reaction as the following chemical equation \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{eq:myoglobin_one_way}\n",
    "\\mathrm{Mb} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\overset{k}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathrm{MbO_2}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation describes the binding reaction where a free myoglobin (Mb) and a oxygen molecule (O$_2$) combine to form a oxymyoglobin (MbO$_2$). This reaction will occur spontaneously, but not instantaneously. Instead it will progress at a certain *rate*, and this is where the law of mass action comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind the law of mass action is that for a binding reaction to occur at all, the two reacting molecules need to be close enough to each other to interact. At the molecular level, the reactants are not stationary, but moving around at high speeds in a chaotic and random manner called thermal motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this motion, many meetings between the reactants will occur. Not every such meeting will results in a binding reaction, but the rate of the reaction at the macroscopic level will therefore be proportional to the number of meetings. But how often do such meetings occur? Because thermal motion is inherently random, it is very reasonable to assume that the number of meetings will be proportional to the concentrations of the reactants. The more molecules available, the more meetings will occur. If we use the square brackets to denote the concentrations, we can write this as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{rate} \\propto [\\mathrm{Mb}]\\times[\\mathrm{O_2}].\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the *rate* of the binding reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reactants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportionality constant for the reaction is typically called the *rate constant* and denoted $k$, which is why we have written this letter the arrow in the chemical equation. The rate constant is related to the probability of the reaction occurring when two such molecules meet, known as the *reaction cross-section*. The higher the chance the molecules have of reacting, the higher the rate constant. The rate constant will therefore be different for different reactions. However, whatever the rate constant, the rate of the reaction will be proportional to the concentrations of the reactants.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rate of the reaction derived, we can set up a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the time evolution of the different concentrations. As we have three molecular species, the two reactants and the one product, we get three ODEs. These become\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d[MbO_2]}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k\\mathrm{[Mb][O_2]}, \\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d [Mb]}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k\\mathrm{[Mb]}\\mathrm{[O_2]}, \\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d [O_2]}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k\\mathrm{[Mb]}\\mathrm{[O_2]}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This system of ODEs is a mathematical model of the binding reaction and we can solve these to find how the concentrations changes over time. To do so we would need a specific value for the rate constant $k$, which we would measure in an empirical experiment. We would also need initial conditions for the three reactions to form a complete initial value problem we can solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "An elementary reaction is any reaction where the reactants combine and form a product in a single step. Not all reactions are elementary, but more complex reactions can be described as a series of elementary reactions. Modeling reactions in this manner using the law of mass action is therefore a general and powerful technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that while we state that the rate is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants, it would be more accurate to say it is proportional to their *activities*. The activity of a given molecular species can be described as the *effective concentration* of a species and it is generally lower than the actual concentration in a more complex solution that do not behave like *ideal solutions* were the reactants are free to move around independently of each other. The details are not that important for our current discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining and scaling rate constants\n",
    "\n",
    "To model chemical reactions with the law of mass action we need to know the rate constants and these must be found empirically. Even though myoglobin is a large and complex macromolecule, its functional behavior however is quite simple to model with the law of mass action as long as we measure its rate constant in an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "We call them rate *constants* because they do not change with the concentrations of the reactants, note however that they can change for other reasons. If the temperature is increased for example the rate of a reaction typically increases as well, and this is captured in the model by increasing the rate constant. The rate constant also depends on other environmental factors such as pressure and pH.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we are mostly looking at closed biological systems where these factors can be considered constant. Therefore, we generally do not need to incorporate temperature or pressure driven shifts in rates in our models. However, it is important to be aware that many experiments carried out in a lab are not carried out as the same temperature as those seen *in situ*. An experiment might be carried out in room temperature (~20$^\\circ$C), but then you want to use it for a model in physiological conditions (~37$^\\circ$C). In this case you would need to scale the rate constant to account for the temperature shift, this is typically done with a temperature coefficient, denoted $Q_{\\rm 10}$, which tells you how much a given model parameter needs to be scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation energy and the Arrhenius equation\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why the reaction rate increases with temperature, we can turn to the *Arrhenius equation*, which states that a general rate constant can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "k = Ae^{-E_{\\rm a}/RT}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $k$ is a rate constant, $A$ is called the pre-exponential factor which is species-dependent but temperature independent, we then have an exponential term where $E_{\\rm a}$ represents the *activation energy* of the reaction, $R$ the ideal gas constant and $T$ the temperature (in absolute units).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrhenius' equation tells us that the rate constant has an exponential dependence on temperature, and as the temperature is lowered, the rate constant is dampened. The activation energy $E_{\\rm a}$ represents the energy the reactants need to overcome to actually react, and it is related to the reaction cross-section described earlier. When the temperature increases, the thermal motion of the reactants is energized and so it will be easier to overcome the activation barrier and actually react.\n",

    "## Reversible reactions\n",

    "When formulating our model for the binding reaction, we made an implicit assumption that the *reverse* reaction doesn't occur, i.e., an oxymyoglobin splitting into an oxygen molecule and a myoglobin, a process we call *dissociation*. Many chemical reactions are reversible, and will occur in both directions, especially so for a closed system such as the inside of a cell. The binding and dissociation of oxygen will occur in parallel and we therefore modify our chemical equation to reflect this\n",

    "## Chemical Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "When modeling a unidirectional chemical reaction, the concentration of the reactants can only drop over time while the concentrations of the product can only increase. When we look at a reversible reaction however, the concentrations of the different molecules can both increase and decrease. Looking at ODE we just formulated for example, we see the concentration of oxymyoglobin increases if the forward rate is larger than the reverse, and decreases if the situation is flipped. As the concentration changes over time however, these two rates will also change and approach each other until we end up in a chemical *equilibrium*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An equilibrium is reached once the forward and reverse rate of the reaction are of equal magnitude and effectively cancel each other out. We can write this as the following equilibrium criteria\n",

    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d[MbO}_2]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = k_+[\\mathrm{Mb}][\\mathrm{O_2}] - k_-[\\mathrm{MbO_2}] = 0 \\quad (\\text{at equilibrium}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This criteria does not say that the reaction has stopped, but rather that the forward and reverse reactions are now occurring at the same rate, meaning there is no *net* change in concentrations. This is referred to as a *dynamic* equilibrium, to emphasize that the reaction is still occurring at the molecular level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium condition states that the two rates are equal\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The ratio of the rate constants is typically referred to as the *dissociation constant* of the reaction, and it is denoted $K_{\\rm d}$. The higher the dissociation constant, the higher the concentrations of the free molecules will tend to be at equilibrium. Some refer to the dissociation constant simply as the *equilibrium* constant, $K_{\\rm eq}$. Note however that the term equilibrium doesn't indicate which direction of the reaction we are referring and so this term could also mean the inverse relation $k_+/k_-$, which would be the *association* constant. There are no strict conventions of which of these are used, and some care should be taken to interpret how the equilibrium constant for a reaction is formulated and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is referred to as *the equilibrium equation* and it describes how the ratio of concentrations will settle at equilibrium. It is a direct consequence of the law of mass action. If one is referring to the law of mass action as an equation, it is typically the equilibrium equation that is meant. Note that the equilibrium equation does not hold at all times, but only when a system is at equilibrium. However, any chemical system will spontaneously tend towards this state, and for many reactions this occurs so swiftly that one can consider the system to always be at equilibrium for all practical purposes.\n",

    "#### Fractional binding\n",

    "Myoglobin is found in muscle cells and in this environment we can think of the total amount of myoglobin as fixed, i.e.,\n",
    "$$[\\mathrm{Mb}]_{\\rm tot} = [\\mathrm{Mb}] + [\\mathrm{MbO_2}] = \\mathrm{const.}$$\n",
    "The total amount of oxygen in the cell however, can change over time. Oxygen is supplied by the circulatory system and is free to diffuse into the cell. When an oxygen binds to myoglobin, more oxygen will spontaneously, and so the concentration of free oxygen $[\\mathrm{O}_2]$ can be thought of as constant within the cell, at least over shorter time scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now introduce the *fractional degree of oxygenation*, i.e., the fraction of all myoglobin molecules that will have oxygen bound to them. This corresponds to the following fraction\n",

    "<center><b>Figure 2:</b> The fractional degree of oxygenation of myoglobin as a function of free oxygen, which we have scaled by the dissociation constant $K_{\\rm d}$.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve tells us the fraction of myoglobin proteins that have oxygen bound to it at different levels of free oxygen. If there is no oxygen available, no myoglobin can bind oxygen either. As some oxygen is added to the system some myoglobin will start binding it. If the concentration of free oxygen is low, the fractional oxygenation will also be low, regardless of how much oxygen is available *in total*, it is the concentration of oxygen that is important, due to the law of mass action. As the concentration of free oxygen increases, so does the degree of oxygenation. Note especially that when $[{\\rm O}_2] = K_{\\rm d}$, we get $Y=0.5$. In this scenario, the dissociation constant is equal to the point of half-saturation of the system. As the oxygen levels rise higher than this the oxygenation rises slower and slower, and you can see the oxygen concentrations need to be very high for the oxygenation of myoglobin to approach 100\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we have derived the fractional oxygenation of myoglobin using the law of mass action and the equilibrium equation. This might seem like a very specific example, especially due to our assumption of a constant level of free oxygen. However, all derivations we have done come directly from the law of mass action and are therefore very general. The assumption of a constant amount of free oxygen can also be a good approximation of a system where there is plentiful of one reactant, and comparatively less of the other. In the live session we will look closer at enzyme kinematics, which we will model as such a system.\n"

    "Note also that some care should be taken when discussing the dissociation constant $K_{\\rm d}$. In our case, we introduced it as $k_{\\rm -}/k_{\\rm +}$, but for our expression of $Y$ to make sense, notice that $K_{\\rm d}$ has to have units of mol$^{n}$.

If we compare the fractional binding curves of myoglobin and hemoglobin at these two levels, we see that the two reach about the same saturation in the lungs, but in the muscles, hemoglobin has a much lower fractional binding. Effectively, this means that hemoglobin is much better suited to act as an oxygen carrier, as it can pick up oxygen in the lungs, and deposit this in the muscles. Myoglobin on the other hand, does not act that well as an oxygen carrier, because it struggles to effectively part with its oxygen unless there is very little oxygen present.\n",

Hemoglobin is found primarily in the blood, where it acts as an oxygen carrier, while myoglobin is found in tissue where it acts more like an oxygen reserve or storage. This functional difference between the two is a results of the cooperativity of the four hemoglobin subunits. This is a common theme in biological systems, where cooperativity between different units will make transitions steeper and functionally different.

The equation is however much more general than this specific example, and can be used to model many types of binding reactions. To emphasize this, let us write it out as a more general equation. In biochemistry, it is common to call the ion or molecule that is being bound the *ligand* and the macromolecule that binds it the *receptor*. A general ligand-receptor binding can then be described with the equation\n",

    "\n",
    "In our example, we showed that the binding curve of hemoglobin has a Hill coefficient of 4, because it binds four oxygen molecules in an all-or-nothing fashion. Recall however, that this was an approximation we made. If you were to measure the actual oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin you would get a result that fits very well to the Hill curve, but with a Hill coefficient of $n=3$ rather than 4. This is because hemoglobin can, and will, bind one, two or three oxygen molecules. Therefore, the Hill coefficient shouldn't be interpreted strictly as the number of units cooperating, but rather the *degree* of cooperativity. In fact, $n$ can even be fractional. Depending on the exact conditions under which you measure the oxygen binding, you'll find a best fit using a coefficient in the range 2.8-3.1. If we interpret the coefficient as a phenomenological parameter trying to catch the degree of cooperativity, using a fractional coefficient to get the best possible fit to measured data makes perfect sense.\n",

    "In general, we can say that $n = 1$ means no cooperativity, i.e., independent binding sites. When we have \n",

    "Gibbs energy is known by many names. Some, like us, call it just Gibbs energy, while it is also commonly called Gibbs \\emph{free} energy. Other names are occasionally used, such as Gibbs function or free enthalpy. When J. W. Gibbs introduced the concept in the 1870s he dubbed it simply *available energy*. This is because the Gibbs energy can be thought of as the maximum amount of work that can be extracted as useful work from a given system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good metaphor for Gibbs energy is found in Schroeder's *An Introduction to Thermal Physics*. Schroeder asks you to imagine a wizard conjuring up a rabbit from nothing. Obviously, the wizard has to respect the laws of thermodynamics, which state that energy cannot be created, and so he will have to supply the needed energy in the process. But how much energy would the wizard need to supply to create the rabbit? First he has to produce the internal energy of the rabbit itself, $U$, which encompasses all the mass energy and all internal chemical energy and so on. If the rabbit were to be created in a complete vacuum, this would be the end of it. However, to get the rabbit to pop into existence in front of you, the wizard actually has to make space for the rabbit by pushing some air aside, which costs mechanical energy. This cost would be $pV$, the higher the air pressure or the bigger the rabbit, the more work has to be performed. The energy bill is now $U + pV$. However, the wizard is quite clever, and so he can save some energy as well. If he conjures up a cold rabbit, he knows the laws of thermodynamics says heat will spontaneously flow from the high temperature surroundings into the low temperature rabbit, so the wizard can subtract this energy from his energy bill. This contribution is $TS$, where $T$ is the temperature of the surroundings and $S$ is the entropy of the rabbit. Why does the entropy enter into it? Because temperature is defined as derivative $T = \\delta U/\\delta S$. So the more entropy the rabbit has, the more thermal energy it will absorb from its environment. The total energy bill the wizard needs to pay is therefore the Gibbs energy $U + pV - TS$. \n",

    "Schroeder's analogy nicely illustrates how Gibbs energy combines different thermodynamics considerations into a single quantity. But if the Gibbs energy represents a *cost*, why is it called the *free* energy? The name describes the reverse process. If an evil wizard were to annihilate a rabit and extract as much energy as possible in the process, we would first get the internal energy $U$ and some extra mechanical work from the surrounding air collapsing into the resulting vacuum. However, they would have to dump som of that energy as heat into the environment to satisfy the second law. The Gibbs free, or available, energy is thus simply the amount of energy a system could release if it were to cease existing.\n",

This happens because non-polar molecules disrupt hydrogen bonds between water molecules, which incurs an increase in the Gibbs energy of the system. By clumping together this effect is minimized and therefore the mixture will spontaneously separate to minimize its Gibbs energy. This is known as the *hydrophobic interaction*. The situation is reversed for hydrophilic, or polar, molecules. Distributing these evenly in a solution increases the entropy of the system and therefore reduces the net Gibbs energy of the system. Polar molecules will therefore spontaneously dissolve into a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phospholipids are *both* hydrophilic and hydrophobic at the same time, so what happens when we try to dissolve them into water? Ideally the heads would dissolve while the tails clump together. Because the two are stuck together they must compromise, and they therefore self-assemble into a structure where the hydrophobic tails are shielded from the water while the hydrophilic heads face outward and towards the surrouding water molecules. One such structure is the *lipid bilayer*.\n",

    "In the bilayer, the phospholipids create two planar sheets that lie in parallel, with the tails of each pointing towards the center. The layers do not allow water to pass in, and so the structure very effectively hides the hydrophobic tails away from the water. The bilayer will have a fixed thickness, but there is no real limit to how large the sheet itself can be, given enough phospholipid molecules. The sheet itself is also quite flexible, and so the whole sheet can loop back around and meet itself, giving a balloon structure. The membrane of a cell is precisely such a structure.\n",

Note that these two driving forces are in general independent of each other and can point in the same, or in opposite directions. As charged ions move through the membrane they will carry an electrical current which will shift the membrane potential. We will now see how this leads to a situation where the system tends towards an equilibrium state were the diffusive and electric terms in the Nernst-Planck equation cancel each other out.\n",

There are equal amounts, so the mixture is electrically neutral. Now we place a high concentration of the mixture inside the cell, and a low concentration outside the cell. Both sides of the membrane are now electrically neutral, as a result, there will be no membrane potential ($V=0$). However, because the concentration is higher inside than outside there will be a concentration gradient across the membrane.\n",

    "Assume now that there are potassium specific ion channels in the membrane that now open up, meaning K$^+$-ions are free to move into or out of the cell. Just as the channels open, there is a large concentration gradient out of the cell but no electric potential. This means that the Nernst-Planck equation reduces to Fick's law and potassium ions will start to diffuse out of the cell through the channels. When potassium ions leave the cell they leave behind a surplus of negatively charged Cl$^-$-ions that have no channels they can diffuse through. This effectively means that as K$^+$-ions leave they cell the cell becomes electrically charged.\n",

Eventually the membrane potential becomes strong enough to cancel out the diffusive flux entirely and the system has reached a new equilibrium. There will still be a concentration gradient across the membrane as well as a membrane potential, but these two perfectly cancel each other out. The situation is shown in the figure below.\n",
